## 1. Nature of Tensions in Learning

ALEPH assumes that productive learning involves tensions—not errors, but internal contradictions:
- Between abstraction and detail
- Between intuition and rigor
- Between control and openness

These tensions create creative pressure.

## 2. Examples of Core Paradoxes

| Paradox | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Focus vs. Divergence | Need to concentrate vs. allow associative branching |
| Certainty vs. Doubt | Build knowledge vs. question assumptions |
| Speed vs. Depth | Cover ground vs. deepen each stop |
| Consistency vs. Evolution | Keep coherence vs. allow conceptual shifts |
| Autonomy vs. Guidance | Self-direction vs. agent scaffolding |

---

## 3. Systemic Management

ALEPH tracks and balances tensions by:
- Logging contradiction markers.
- Surfacing paradoxes when thresholds are crossed.
- Prompting the learner to reflect or choose direction.
- Letting agents debate and present opposing framings.

## 4. Agent Roles

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Meta-Teacher | Identifies recurring tensions |
| Philosopher | Frames tensions as productive paradoxes |
| Curator | Finds sources where paradoxes are addressed |
| Synthesizer | Proposes temporary resolutions or integrations |

---

## 5. Open Questions

- Should the user be made aware of paradoxes or shielded?
- How can ALEPH avoid over-resolving tension too early?
- Can paradox awareness become a learning competency?
