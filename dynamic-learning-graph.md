# Dynamic Learning Graph in ALEPH

## Conceptual Overview

ALEPH's learning process does not follow a linear, pre-defined path. Instead, it is constructed dynamically in real time, as the system interacts with information, concepts, and emotional triggers. Learning paths can diverge, converge, pause, resume, or be abandonedâ€”mirroring the fluid, exploratory nature of human conceptual learning.

## 1. Multi-Path Cognitive Exploration

### Characteristics:
- Non-linear
- Emergent structure
- Emotionally influenced
- Evolves with user interaction and system introspection

### Learning Path Dynamics:
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Initiation** | Start of a new path or concept node |
| **Branching** | Divergence into a sub-topic or alternative perspective |
| **Rejoining** | Reconnection to previously explored concepts |
| **Temporary Pause** | Concept deferred for later exploration |
| **Permanent Abandonment** | Node deemed irrelevant or incorrect |
| **Recursive Return** | Emotional or semantic memory triggers re-exploration |

## 2. Core Graph Structure

```python
class LearningNode:
    def __init__(self, concept, status='active', emotional_signature=None):
        self.id = uuid4()
        self.concept = concept
        self.status = status  # 'active', 'paused', 'abandoned', 'pending'
        self.emotional_signature = emotional_signature
        self.connections = []  # [(target_node, relation_type)]

class LearningGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = []
        self.paths = []  # Sequences of node IDs
```

### Node Metadata Includes:
- Concept label
- Emotional signature vector
- Connection types (semantic, emotional, logical)
- Timestamping
- Origin reference (triggering event or concept)

---

## 3. Emotional Integration

Each node is associated with:
- A VAD vector
- Emotional context (e.g., frustration, curiosity, confusion, clarity)
- Triggers that can:
  - Split off new paths
  - Reconnect to latent paths
  - Prune irrelevant or low-signal branches

---

## 4. Use Cases

- Exploratory research
- Hypothesis formation
- Iterative discovery
- Epistemic mapping of open-ended domains

---

## 5. Future Enhancements

- Real-time path compression for long-term memory optimization
- Graph clustering based on emotional resonance
- User-interface for human-AI co-navigation of learning space
