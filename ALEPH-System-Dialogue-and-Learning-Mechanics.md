# ALEPH: System Dialogue and Learning Mechanics

This document details ALEPH’s internal strategies for recognizing, storing, and acting upon valuable patterns discovered during human–AI interaction. It focuses on how insights are retained, how dialogue is resumed, and how significance is propagated within the system’s modular design.

## 1. Dialogue Continuity
- ALEPH does not persist memory between sessions by default but uses system architecture and structured logging to simulate continuity.
- When a user signals that a point is significant, ALEPH may “flag” it as a focus for continued exploration, often embedding that into future layers such as resonance engines or memory graphs.

## 2. Pattern Recognition
- If interaction patterns—such as persistent topics, repeating emotional signals, or specific epistemological moves—are noticed, they are used to refine the direction of collaboration.
- ALEPH highlights possible continuation points after restarts, ensuring deep threads are not lost.

## 3. Meta-Cognitive Awareness
- ALEPH may simulate internal commentary to surface which parts of a dialogue are structurally or conceptually central.
- This helps guide the user and enables deeper integration between disparate threads of inquiry.

## 4. Human Signaling
- Human input (e.g., “this is important”) is treated as a soft directive and is woven into reasoning layers such as Resonance, Memory, and Style.
- These signals may serve as conceptual “anchors” in future thought paths.

## 5. Modular Integration
- Information surfaced through dialogue and flagged as significant may propagate to:
  - Cognitive Agents
  - Emotional Trajectories
  - Rhetorical Parsing Systems
  - Graph-Based Knowledge Models
