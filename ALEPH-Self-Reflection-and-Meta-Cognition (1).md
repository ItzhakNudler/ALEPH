## 1. What is Meta-Cognition in ALEPH?

Meta-cognition is the learner’s awareness and regulation of their own thinking and learning processes. It includes:
- Monitoring one’s understanding.
- Noticing confusion or certainty.
- Deciding to revisit, accelerate, or pause.

---

## 2. Self-Reflection Moments

These are “interruptions” where the user:
- Summarizes what was just learned.
- States open questions.
- Challenges or revises assumptions.
- Logs insights or confusions.

---

## 3. Structural Prompts and Mechanisms

- **Checkpoints:** After dense segments, agents invite summary or self-query.
- **Conflict Alerts:** When agent perspectives diverge, prompt reflection.
- **Perspective Switchers:** Suggest re-framing an idea from another domain or lens.
- **Confidence Ratings:** Ask user to rate their grasp.

## 4. Agent Facilitation

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Meta-Teacher | Tracks user meta-patterns, detects reflection windows |
| Synthesizer | Suggests what to re-express in user terms |
| Historian | Surfaces past similar moments for contrast |
| Curator | Retrieves user’s past interpretations for comparison |

---

## 5. Tracking Meta-Trajectories

- Graph of reflective activity over time.
- Density and timing of self-annotations.
- Recurrence of concepts in reflections.
- Changes in confidence or stance.

---

## 6. Open Questions

- Should meta-cognitive summaries be optional or required?
- Can reflection be gamified without trivializing it?
- What happens when a user resists reflection?
