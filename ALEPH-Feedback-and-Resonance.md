# ALEPH — Feedback and Resonance Mechanisms

## 1. Overview: Purpose of Feedback and Resonance in ALEPH

Feedback and resonance mechanisms form the connective tissue between ALEPH’s cognitive modules, allowing the system to not only adapt to user inputs but also shape and be shaped by its ongoing interaction with the user. These mechanisms enable long-term personalization, dynamic learning, and mutual alignment between user intent and agent response.

## 2. Multi-Layer Feedback Loops

### 2.1 Layer 1: Immediate Semantic Feedback
- Real-time semantic parsing of user input.
- Matching user input to existing knowledge structures.
- Triggering relevant sub-agents or memory retrieval.

### 2.2 Layer 2: Reflective Feedback
- Evaluates the outcome of previous interactions.
- Adjusts internal prioritization of responses.
- Builds a short-term context window of "learning moments".

### 2.3 Layer 3: Meta-Cognitive Feedback
- Tracks trends in user behavior, tone, and direction.
- Assesses the match between system responses and user engagement.
- Directs long-term adaptation of interaction styles.

## 3. Resonance Agents

### 3.1 Purpose
Resonance agents are designed to track and align with the user’s "inner thread" — emotional, cognitive, and conceptual resonance.

### 3.2 Characteristics
- Maintain a vectorized map of recurring themes and concerns.
- Monitor subtle shifts in user tone, metaphors, or inquiries.
- Guide the activation of memory or insight-generation agents.

## 4. Feedback Learning Algorithms

### 4.1 NLP-Based Resonance Detection
- Embedding techniques (e.g., BERT, Sentence Transformers).
- Topic drift analysis and semantic clustering.
- Concept frequency heatmaps over time.

### 4.2 Reinforcement Learning Approaches
- Policy gradient methods (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO) to optimize dialogue success metrics.
- Reward shaping based on user’s positive/neutral/negative cues.
- Learning when to re-ask, rephrase, or switch modality.

### 4.3 Graph-Based Models
- Dynamic Concept Maps enriched by user interactions.
- Embedding propagation across knowledge subgraphs.
- Detecting resonance via path similarity and edge-weight reinforcement.

## 5. Feedback Channel Types

- **Explicit Feedback**: User ratings, corrections, or affirmations.
- **Implicit Feedback**: Hesitations, revisions, tonal changes.
- **Meta-Feedback**: Requests to go deeper, shift topic, or change level of abstraction.

## 6. Summary

These feedback and resonance systems together create a self-correcting, context-sensitive dialogue engine. ALEPH is not merely a passive responder, but an agent in dynamic co-evolution with the user’s thought process.

This document will evolve to include:
- Implementation schemas
- Signal-processing diagrams
- Comparative analysis of learning algorithms
- Open questions for future enhancement
