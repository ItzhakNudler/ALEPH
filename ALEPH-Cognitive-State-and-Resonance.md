## 1. Introduction
The concept of "Cognitive State" in ALEPH includes both measurable indicators and inferred states related to learning readiness, engagement, and internal conceptual reactivity ("resonance").

---

## 2. Defining Cognitive State

- **Cognitive-Emotional State** is defined as a cluster of parameters including:
  - Focus duration
  - Switching frequency between topics
  - Reaction types to stimuli (pause, skip, overreaction)
- These are derived through session metadata and timing features.

---

## 3. Attention Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Attention Span | Time (in seconds) focused on a single topic |
| Switching Frequency | Number of concept/topic switches per unit time |
| Re-engagement Rate | Probability of returning to previously skipped material |

---

## 4. Emotional-Cognitive Load

- **Defined by:**
  - Rate of unresolved questions
  - Depth of branching during concept exploration
  - Self-reported or inferred states of tension/fatigue/excitement

- **Inferred from:**
  - Tempo of dialogue
  - Verbosity and latency
  - Deviation from expected concept path

---

## 5. Resonance Level

- Resonance reflects how strongly a concept "activates" internal cognitive networks.
- **Measured by:**
  - Number of triggered associations
  - Strength of validation signals
  - Presence of feedback loops

| Parameter | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Activated Links | >10 conceptual neighbors |
| Feedback Echoes | Recurrence of the same insight across time |
| Emotional Intensity | Detected via lexical patterns or user annotation |

---

## 6. Open Questions

- Can resonance be used as a prediction metric for user retention?
- What is the threshold for "excessive resonance" (overload)?
- Should agents pause ("re-align") after high resonance events?
