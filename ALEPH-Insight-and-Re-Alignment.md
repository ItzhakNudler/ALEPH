## 1. Defining Insight Events

An **Insight Event** is a moment in which the learner:
- Forms a novel connection between concepts.
- Reframes a mental model.
- Experiences a shift in understanding or perspective.

These events often emerge at convergence points in learning flows.

---

## 2. Deep Insight vs. Shallow Insight

| Insight Type | Characteristics |
|--------------|------------------|
| Deep Insight | Cross-domain, long retention, emotionally marked |
| Shallow Insight | Local, short-term clarity, low cognitive ripple |

Deep insights often demand restructuring of prior knowledge.

---

## 3. Conceptual Jumps

A **Conceptual Jump** is a discontinuous leap:
- Not directly inferable from prior steps.
- Often metaphorical or emergent.
- May be perceived as “non-linear” or unexpected.

These events can be seeded by associative flows, or triggered by tension in current knowledge structures.

---

## 4. The Role of Re-Alignment

Re-Alignment is a coordinated pause and synchronization of agents, triggered after high-impact insight events.  
Goals:
- Re-stabilize the internal semantic network.
- Surface the insight for reflection.
- Update meta-context of learning flow.
- Reconfigure flow parameters if needed.

## 5. Triggers and Criteria

| Trigger Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Insight Density Spike | Several insight markers detected within short interval |
| Feedback Loop Closure | Repetition or echo of earlier ideas, closing a loop |
| Emotional Surge | Detected through lexical/emotional signals |
| User Annotation | Bookmark, highlight, or “wow” marker |
| Agent Conflict | Contradictory agent outputs that signal cognitive tension |

---

## 6. Agent Dynamics During Pause

During Re-Alignment:
- **Flowing agents** (Explorer, Synthesizer) are temporarily silenced.
- **Meta-agents** (Meta-Teacher, Historian) analyze trajectory.
- **Reflective Agents** offer summarizations, analogies, and "meaning probes".
- Post-analysis, agents re-negotiate direction or continue flow.

---

## 7. Open Questions

- Should the learner be explicitly notified of a Re-Alignment event?
- Can conceptual jumps be modeled probabilistically?
- How can we differentiate between chaotic divergence and insight?
