## 1. What is Interpretation in ALEPH?

Interpretation is the learner’s act of:
- Reframing a concept in personal or symbolic terms.
- Assigning new meaning based on inner resonance.
- Connecting the concept to identity, memory, or mission.

This marks the internalization of knowledge.

## 2. Symbolic Operations

| Operation Type | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Personal Metaphor | “This algorithm feels like weaving a net” |
| Internal Mapping | Linking a new idea to a life event |
| Conceptual Fusion | Merging two ideas into a new hybrid notion |
| Mythic Projection | Placing a concept in a narrative/mythic lens |

These symbolic acts deepen cognitive anchoring.

## 3. Forms of Semantic Marking

- Highlighting or bookmarking with custom meaning
- Creating personalized tags or clusters
- Re-naming a concept
- Creating analogies or private associations

---

## 4. Roles of Personalization

Interpretation serves:
- Long-term encoding
- Narrative integration
- Emotional reinforcement
- Creative tension (used later in divergent flows)

---

## 5. Agent Interactions

- **Reflective Agent:** invites personal commentary
- **Philosopher Agent:** proposes interpretive framings
- **Meta-Teacher Agent:** tracks which ideas triggered symbolic acts
- **Lexicon Agent:** adds symbols and metaphors to personal lexicon layer

---

## 6. Open Questions

- How can symbolic interpretation be scaffolded for different users?
- Should the system suggest metaphors, or wait for spontaneous emergence?
- Can private symbols be shared or recombined by agents?
