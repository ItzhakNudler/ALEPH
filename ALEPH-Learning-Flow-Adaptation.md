## 1. Overview
Learning in ALEPH is structured around dynamic "flows"—sequences of conceptual, associative, or analytical steps. These flows are continuously adapted to match the learner’s evolving context, goals, and state.

---

## 2. What is a Learning Flow?

- A temporally ordered series of semantic operations.
- Initiated by curiosity, a question, or an insight.
- Consists of agent-initiated steps (e.g., search, synthesize, reflect, diverge).
- Tracked via a Flow ID and Meta-Context Record.

## 3. Types of Flows

| Flow Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Associative | Follows intuitive or metaphorical links between ideas |
| Systematic | Based on structured progression (taxonomy, prerequisites) |
| Convergent | Aims to synthesize inputs from multiple domains |
| Divergent | Branches into exploratory or creative trajectories |
| Reflective | Recaps, abstracts, and triggers meta-cognition |

## 4. Adaptation Mechanisms

Adaptation is driven by a combination of:

- **Cognitive-State Signals:** from user and system.
- **Context Shifts:** triggered by user or agent.
- **Goal Re-alignment:** when learning goal is updated or reframed.
- **Flow Resonance:** strength of engagement or concept activation.

Each adaptation may lead to:
- Pausing current flow.
- Switching to a different flow type.
- Re-routing agents.
- Offering reflective synthesis to stabilize learning.

---

## 5. Monitoring and Feedback

- Every Flow is wrapped with meta-data:
  - Start/end timestamps
  - Conceptual trajectory (nodes visited)
  - Cognitive metrics (engagement, dwell time, branching factor)

- Feedback signals:
  - Explicit (user annotation, bookmarks, questions)
  - Implicit (timing, skips, repetition)

---

## 6. Agent Roles

- **Meta-Teacher Agent:** oversees flow harmony, suggests pivots.
- **Flow-Synthesizer Agent:** combines fragmented steps into narratives.
- **Explorer Agent:** suggests alternative directions.
- **Curator Agent:** injects new stimuli or clarifications.

## 7. Open Questions

- What is the threshold for a “broken” flow?
- Can competing flows be merged or compared?
- Should agents self-evaluate flow productivity?
