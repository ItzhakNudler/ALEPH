# Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST): Relations, Functions, and Examples

This document provides a structured reference for the 30+ canonical rhetorical relations in Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), as applied in the context of the ALEPH system.

## üìå Overview

In RST, texts are analyzed as hierarchies of connected spans called **EDUs** (Elementary Discourse Units). These units are related through **rhetorical relations**, where one part (typically the *Satellite*) supports or elaborates upon the other (the *Nucleus*).

## üîó Canonical RST Relations

Below is a categorized list of major rhetorical relations, including definitions and illustrative examples.

---

### 1. **Elaboration**
- **Function**: Adds more detail to a general statement.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "She had a difficult year."
  - Satellite: "She lost her job, moved cities, and dealt with illness."

---

### 2. **Explanation**
- **Function**: Clarifies or justifies the nucleus.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "He didn‚Äôt come to the meeting."
  - Satellite: "Because his flight was delayed."

---

### 3. **Background**
- **Function**: Provides context or situational framing.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "He walked into the courtroom."
  - Satellite: "It was his first trial as a defense attorney."

---

### 4. **Justify**
- **Function**: Offers support for why the nucleus should be believed.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "We should cancel the trip."
  - Satellite: "All forecasts show severe weather."

---

### 5. **Contrast**
- **Function**: Highlights differences between units.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "She enjoys quiet weekends."
  - Satellite: "He prefers parties and loud music."

---

### 6. **Concession**
- **Function**: Acknowledges an opposing view without invalidating the nucleus.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "The policy was effective."
  - Satellite: "Even though it was initially controversial."

---

### 7. **Condition**
- **Function**: Sets a condition on the nucleus.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "You can go to the concert."
  - Satellite: "If you finish your homework."

---

### 8. **Cause / Result**
- **Function**: Shows causality.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "The streets flooded."
  - Satellite: "Because of heavy rainfall."

---

### 9. **Evidence**
- **Function**: Offers proof or support.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "This approach improves efficiency."
  - Satellite: "A recent study showed a 20% time reduction."

---

### 10. **Summary**
- **Function**: Condenses preceding text.
- **Example**:
  - Nucleus: "Overall, the project succeeded."
  - Satellite: (Several paragraphs outlining the project details.)

## üìÅ Integration in ALEPH

In the ALEPH system, these rhetorical relations are:
- Detected via discourse parsing modules
- Represented in the Dialogue Memory Graph
- Used by the Resonance Engine for coherence assessment and trajectory analysis

## üîÑ Future Additions
- Add Hebrew language examples
- Link to actual EDU segmentation strategies
- Integrate with Reflective Coherence Model schema
