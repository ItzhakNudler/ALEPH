## 1. Overview

This document details the agent topology and dynamic interaction patterns in the ALEPH ecosystem. It expands the architectural logic laid out in the base `ALEPH-Architecture.md` document.

## 2. Agent Layering: Structural Topology

ALEPH’s agent-based topology is not flat but stratified into **conceptual layers**. Each layer denotes a functional or cognitive altitude.

### Layers:

- **Cognitive Agents** – Perform interpretation, idea synthesis, abstraction.
- **Operational Agents** – Execute concrete learning actions, parsing, summarization.
- **Supervisory Agents** – Coordinate learning logic, timing, agent delegation.
- **Meta-Agents** – Oversee meta-cognition, intent-tracking, alignment verification.

Each layer interfaces bi-directionally with others through a dynamic signaling layer (see §3).

## 3. Bus-Driven Coordination Logic

Agent communication is handled through distinct message buses:

### 3.1 Semantic Bus
Exchanges concepts, references, analogies, taxonomic alignment, terminology refinement.

### 3.2 Procedural Bus
Synchronizes agent states, triggers, scheduling of phases in associative/systematic flows.

### 3.3 Affective Bus
Shares load signals, uncertainty reports, meta-cognitive flags, or user tension feedback.

Each agent “subscribes” to only relevant buses. A **Routing Engine** matches messages to recipient agents.

## 4. Emergent Roles and Dynamic Activation

Agents are activated not only by static assignment but also through **emergent triggers**.  
Examples:
- A Synthesizer Agent may summon a Philosopher Agent if it detects cross-domain ambiguity.
- A Curator Agent might raise a Meta-Agent signal if input overload is detected.

This allows **fluid role-shifting** and **contextual reconfiguration** of the network.

---

## 5. Inter-Agent Feedback Loops

Feedback mechanisms ensure convergence and clarity:
- Pingbacks: One agent queries another for validation.
- Reflective Loop: Agent pauses to ask, “Did we diverge from learning intent?”
- Echo Validation: Multiple agents converge on aligned synthesis independently.

These loops allow trust-building across agents and traceability of thought paths.

## 6. Core Concepts and Terminology (Expanded)

### Emergent Cognition  
Learning as an adaptive system of interacting parts. Knowledge arises from the interactions—not just the parts.

### Functional Modularity  
Each agent is built as a distinct software unit (module) with API-like inputs/outputs.

### Reflexivity  
Agents contain logic for self-evaluation or introspective meta-signaling.

### Dynamism  
ALEPH is not a static graph; its activation paths reconfigure during sessions.

### Polyvocality  
Multiple agents “speak” and reason in parallel, offering multi-perspective learning.

These concepts are interdependent:
- *Emergence* is made possible through *polyvocality* and *dynamism*.
- *Reflexivity* ensures meta-alignment across modules.
- *Functional modularity* enables scalable agent integration.

## 7. Modularity & Integration Logic

### What is a “Module” in ALEPH?

Each agent is implemented as a **loosely coupled software module**, meaning:
- It exposes defined interfaces (input/output formats).
- It can be activated or deactivated based on session needs.
- It communicates via the Bus system.

### What is a “Contract”?

A **contract** in this context defines:
- The kinds of data an agent accepts.
- The outputs it produces.
- Preconditions or context-awareness needed for it to function.

A **flexible contract** allows partial compliance or dynamic adaptation based on context.

### Registering New Agents

To integrate a new agent:
- It must subscribe to relevant Bus channels (semantic, procedural, etc.).
- It must conform to one or more existing learning contracts.
- It must register with the overarching **Methodology Engine**.

### What is the Methodology?

The **Methodology** defines:
- What flows are permitted (e.g., Associative → Systematic → Reflective).
- What learning intents exist (exploration, validation, synthesis).
- What agent roles are valid in each phase.

New agents “register” to the methodology by:
- Declaring their compatible roles.
- Accepting flow constraints.
- Providing feedback hooks into meta-monitoring.

This enables ALEPH to remain extensible while preserving structural coherence.
