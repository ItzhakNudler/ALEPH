# ALEPH System Interfaces — v2

This document provides an expanded explanation of the interface layers and interaction mechanisms in the ALEPH system.

---

## 1. Overview

ALEPH is structured around modular interfaces designed to support a dynamic, agent-driven architecture. Each layer in the system corresponds to a functional or cognitive component and interacts via communication protocols, shared memory, or routing logic.

## 2. Interface Layers — Expanded Description

### 2.1 Sensory Input Interface

- **Purpose:** Accepts structured and unstructured inputs (text, data, audio descriptors).
- **Mechanisms:** Pre-processing pipeline: normalization → tokenization → semantic mapping.
- **Rationale:** Bridges raw input with ALEPH’s internal semantic frameworks.

### 2.2 Cognitive Workspace Interface

- **Purpose:** Temporary processing space where concepts are evaluated, related, contrasted.
- **Mechanisms:** Concept graphs, attention filters, relevance heuristics.
- **Rationale:** Emulates a dynamic “working memory” where active reasoning occurs.

### 2.3 Long-Term Knowledge Interface

- **Purpose:** Accesses structured conceptual knowledge, ontologies, user-specific histories.
- **Mechanisms:** Query system + vector retrieval + symbolic lookups.
- **Rationale:** Provides semantic grounding and deep memory traces.

### 2.4 Agent Loop Interface

- **Purpose:** Enables each agent to act, learn, and communicate via messages and subscriptions.
- **Mechanisms:** Pub-sub channels (Bus), rule-based triggers, reinforcement signals.
- **Rationale:** Ensures modular, scalable cognitive agents.

### 2.5 Meta-Agent Coordination Interface

- **Purpose:** Orchestrates flows between agents and modules, guided by user intent.
- **Mechanisms:** Delegation rules, time-bound tasks, priority resolution.
- **Rationale:** Reflects user as primary conductor of internal symphony.

### 2.6 Context Capsule Interface

- **Purpose:** Binds episodic memory into reusable, structured units.
- **Mechanisms:** Metadata + key terms + time/location + narrative hooks.
- **Rationale:** Supports recall, analogical reasoning, memory compression.

### 2.7 Reflection & Meta-Cognition Interface

- **Purpose:** Supports recursive evaluation, strategy adaptation, error-checking.
- **Mechanisms:** Flow trackers, meta-cognitive units, coherence meters.
- **Rationale:** Powers learning from prior sessions and adaptivity over time.

## 3. Notes

- Interfaces may evolve as ALEPH expands.
- Each layer logs structured traces for longitudinal analysis.
- Higher-order layers can “query down” to lower layers for synthesis.
